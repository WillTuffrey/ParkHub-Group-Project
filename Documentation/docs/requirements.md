## User Needs

### User stories    TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

1. As a user, they would like to know where the nearest parking is to the location, so that they know before setting off where to go.
2. As a user, they would like to know what the best-priced parking is available around the location, so that they can plan and choose the best parking for their needs.
3. As a user, they would want to see available parking spots in real time so they can find a space quickly.
4. As a user, they would want to reserve a parking spot ahead of time to avoid wasting time searching.
5. As a user, they would want to pay for parking online to speed up their exit from the lot.
6. As a user, they would want to receive a digital receipt as proof of payment.
7. As a user, they would want to get notified before their parking expires, so they can extend their time or move their car.
