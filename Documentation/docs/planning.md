# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement   (TODO: Replace the example text like this with text that describes your project. What is the problem to be addressed?)
Finding the right car park can be difficult, and other map and route planning apps can be unreliable. This is mainly due to parking not being a priority for the users or customers of said software, so they don’t implement it. Having a way to filter the conditions for the car park the user is looking for, from price, space and operation hours and other parameters would be a very valuable tool for both regular drivers and people just visiting the city.
In Bristol, especially around the city centre, parking can be quite hard to come by. This is greatly increased during university term time. The University of the West of England and The University of Bristol combined have around 90,000 students with another estimated 12,000 staff between the 2, so it’s no surprise that during term time, the availability of parking becomes even more scarce.
Bristol is also ranked 6th in the UK for population density, and while the city has an excellent public transport system, having access to a car is still very useful. For people who have mobility issues, or who live around the outskirts of the city, having access to an easy-to-use piece of software like this will be game changing.


### Business benefits   (TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.)
Makes it easier to plan out a journey for the user, with multiple options for filtering results. It makes it easier for the user by knowing which is the best car park for the conditions the user needs it for. 


### Options Considered  (TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?)
Mipermit and Google Maps, the issues with those apps are that on Google Maps, some of the information is provided incorrectly. And with MiPermit, it does show you the operation times and pricing, but it isn’t intuitive with users, and you can only pay in the app. There are no filters as well.


### Expected Risks  (TODO: What are the main risks of this project?)
Security risks, any breach in user data and personal record could result in legal battles. Back-end to front-end integration, things could break and cause problems for the user while using the app.

COSTS
* Cost for running the server
* Someone will have to maintain the app, and potentially update it periodically
* Any licences for data or use of other APIs - for example, the use of a maps display service to make the locations easier to understand for the user
